# Graph-DP-BnB-AStar

#### Graph-DP-BnB-AStar is written in Java

## Purpose

Unified graph-oriented view to solve single-reduction problems through DP, BnB and A* algorithms.

## Requirements

Java $\geq$ 20

## Usage

Generic and reusable implementations for Dynamic Programming (DP), Branch and Bound (BnB) and A* algorithms, presenting a unified graph-oriented view of the reasoning to be followed to solve a single-reduction problem through these techniques. We model a generic extended graph that becomes specific by including information of the concrete problem to be solved. The latter is then used as a common input for DP, BnB and A* algorithms. Such implementations have been developed by paying special attention to well-known good practices in the design of software, such as reusability and use of design patterns. We provide 4 case studies.
